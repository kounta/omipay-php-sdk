# Omipay PHP SDK

## Intro
This is not an official SDK for Omipay. It is a side project to transfer Omipay SDK to a PSR compliance module.

## Install
run
```
composer require softbread/omipay-php-sdk  "@dev"
```
or add to composer.json
```
"softbread/omipay-php-sdk": "@dev"
```
## Usage
Please read Omipay API documents.

## Road Map
1. Fix Namespace
2. Use Guzzle to replace curl for better error handling
3. Simplify the classes
4. Add demos
